# About
This is a fork of the Mupen64 emulator, made with the C/C++ languages. <br>
The difference being, this one is supposed to output unstable/glitchy emulations.

Just clone this repo, go to is folder and run the ./build.sh file. It will install all necessary libs (as of Ubunut 18.04), build, and test the application.

Doing so, will generate a ./bin folder.

# Running ROMs
First, find a .z64 ROM and place it inside the ROMS folder. 
Then, go to the ./bin folder and run `./mupen64plus ../ROMS/your_rom.z64`
